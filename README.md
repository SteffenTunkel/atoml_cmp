# mlCrossRef

## Description
A tool for the comparative testing between multiple machine learning frameworks (sklearn, spark, weka). The test generation, including the test data and the test script, is generated by atoml. The different ml frameworks and atoml are run inside docker container for each. Therefore, the requirements for the tool are only a docker installation and python with the packages in the requirements.txt.  

## Instructions
1. define the algorithms in a YAML file in the algorithm-descriptions folder
2. create the needed docker images and setup the environments with the build_docker.py
3. create the tests and run them with the run_docker.py
4. compare the different predictions with the compare_results.py

## Notes
Atoml's functions of parametrization and multiple test iterations is currently not supported by the tool, due to the csv naming format.
