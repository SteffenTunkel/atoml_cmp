![CI](https://github.com/steffentunkel/atoml_cmp/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Description
A tool for the comparative testing of different machine learning frameworks.
On one hand the tool offers functionalities to set up and run the test generation and also the test execution in a
containerized manner.
The test generation, including the test data and the test script, is generated by atoml(link).  
Additionally, the tool offers an evaluation pipeline to actually compare the predictions of the different machine
learning algorithms. 

Overall the requirements for the tool are only a docker installation and python with the packages in the requirements.txt.  

Currently, the tool is supporting Scikit-Learn (Python), Weka (Java), Apache Spark MLLib (Scala) and Caret (R).

## Instructions
1. define the algorithms in a YAML file in the algorithm-descriptions folder
2. create the needed docker images and set up the environments with the build_docker.py
3. create the tests, run and evaluate them with the run_tool.py

## Roadmap
- reformat tool into an actual package
